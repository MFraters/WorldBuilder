What is the GWB?
================

The geodynamic models can be divided in **three broad classes**. 

1. The case which involve simplistic geometries for generic modelling and are easy to paramiterize. 
2. The case which consists of those (often instantaneous) models which use tomographic data sets as a starting point. 
3. The case which blends complex 3d interpretation driven detailed geometrical features and thermal fields. 

**The GWB has been designed with this third class in mind**, but is (possibly) capable of creating models for the other cases.

With the advance and the widespread availability of ever more powerful computers to the geodynamic community, detailed regional 3D problems are now within computational range. Although successful attempts have been published, such model setups can not be easily created, adapted within the same code, shared with the community nor be transferred to an other code.

The GWB has been designed to solve all these problems at once, thereby also promoting reproducibility and open science. 
Finally, thanks to its intuitive and simple design, the GWB is easy to use by students and researchers alike. Besides setting up geodynamic models, it can also be used to visualize geological or geodynamic ideas with the Visualization utility.
